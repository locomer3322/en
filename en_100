Nice to meet you.
Shall we dance?
Shall I begin now?
Feel free to try it.
Why don't you take a rest?
You deserve to take a day off.
I'm not going to take it anymore.
You will have to buy a car.
You don't have to lie.
You didn't have to say that.
Do you want me to dance?
I'd like to go home
Would you like to say something?
What would you like to say?
I don't want you to break my heart.
I told you not to play piano at night.
I use to have a good memory.
I use to be able to run fast.
You will be able to sleep well.
You had better listen to me.
I've decided to buy a new car.
Why should I go widh you?
Not everyone likes you.
I was shocked to know that.
You're crazy to say that.
I've decided not to keep silent anymore.
How open do you guys meet up?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
How could you open the door?
How can I reach you?
How soon can you decide?
All I'm asking is to keep your promise
You are the only one I want.
I'm not the one who cook this.
That's not the way I cook.
I would rather die.
Would you mind if I sit here?
How long does it take to deliver?
Untill when will you stay here?
By when should I answer?
If I were you I wouldn't quit the job.
I wish I could turn back time.
Let's say you are the boss.
Don't tell me you didn't know.
How come you are here?
What if I say no?
I want to know whether she fovgave me.
When was the last time I saw you?
I appreciate it if you show me the sample.
I wish I were smarter.
