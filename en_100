Nice to meet you.
Shall we dance?
Shall I begin now?
Feel free to try it.
Why don't you take a rest?
You deserve to take a day off.
I'm not going to take it anymore.
You will have to buy a car.
You don't have to lie.
You didn't have to say that.
Do you want me to dance?
Would you like to say something?
What would you like to say?
I don't want you to break my heart.
I told you not to play piano at night.
I use to have a good memory.
I use to be able to run fast.
You will be able to sleep well.
You had better listen to me.
