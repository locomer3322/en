It's nice to meet you.
Shall we dance?
Shall I begin now?
Feel free try it.
Why don't you take a rest?
You deserve to take a rest.
I'm not going to take it anymore.
You will have to buy a car.
You don't have to lie.
You didn't have to say that.
Do you want me to dance?
I would like to go home.
Would you like to say something?
What would you like to say?
I don't want you to break my heart.
I told you not to play the piano at night.
I used to have a good memory.
I used to be able to run fast.
You will be able to sleep well.
You had better listen to me.
I've decided to buy a new car.
Why should I go with you?
Not everyone likes you.
I was shocked to know that.
You're crazy to say that.
I've decided not to keep silent anymore.
How often do you guys meet up?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
How could you open the door?
How can I reach you?
How soon can you decide?
All I'm asking is to keep your promise.
You're the only one I want.
I'm not the one who cook this.
That's not the way I cook.
I would rather die.
Would you mind if I seat here?
How long does it take to deliver?
Untill when will you stay here?
By when should I answer?
If I were you I wouldn't quit the job.
I wish I could turn back time.
